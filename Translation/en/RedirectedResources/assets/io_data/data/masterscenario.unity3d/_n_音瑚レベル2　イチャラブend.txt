The project I was involved in at work had a big 
change, and no matter how I tried to extricate 
myself, I couldn't find the time to go to the club.

Even if I wanted to see her, I couldn't find any 
chances to go and actually do it.

Finally, it was more or less resolved. I can 
finally go to the club... finally see and have fun 
with Neko-chan now.

I quickly picked up the phone and called to put in 
a booking.

//SE コール音など

It rang for a bit... then connected. After the 
usual pleasantries, I got to the point.

***SE_END

主人公
『So, I would like to book Neko-chan for tomorrow 
right from when the club opens up...』

スタッフ
『Our apologies. She already has an appointment for 
that time...』

Eh? ...She has other clients than me?

Or, did Neko-chan's complaints finally get through 
and they blacklisted me??

But if so, I'd have been blacklisted the moment I 
assaulted her in her sleep back then.

主人公
『Ah, is that so? Then, is she free tomorrow? If 
so, when?』

I calmed down, and asked when she'd be free.

スタッフ
『Our deepest apologies. Her time is already 
completely reserved for tomorrow as well... 
however, she's currently free all day for the day after tomorrow.』

What is this...

Is someone else trying to monopolize her too? Or 
does she have just that many more customers now...

In any case, it seems like I'm not blacklisted or 
anything.

While being submerged in the sudden gloominess, I 
booked her out completely on the day after 
tomorrow, from opening till closing, then cut the call.

---------------

――

I didn't manage to calm down at all, and before I 
knew it, it was the day.

Neko-chan, of all people, has customers. She's 
'servicing' other men... in other words, having 
sex with them.

When I thought about it, I couldn't control myself 
and ended up showing up to the club even before 
the reservation time.

主人公
『Maybe I'll get something to drink....』

I loitered around aimlessly, not even sitting down 
anywhere, while thinking things that I usually 
wouldn't.

兎萌(CH02_0041)
『Oh my~. Onii-san, you came quite early today, 
didn't you? You might be the first one here.』

Hearing a familiar voice, I raised my face only to 
see Tomoe-san there.

主人公
『Ah, hello...』

In response to a greeting like that, I ended up 
replying without any energy and spirit.

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0042)
『Coming so early... it's Neko-chan again today, 
no? But you seem very down today. If I'll do, then 
I really don't mind lending you an ear, you know?』

主人公
『No, it's just that I've just been unable to come 
in for quite a few days, and seeing her schedule 
so full surprised me, that's all.』

I said that and nothing more, with a bitter laugh. 
I don't want to show Tomoe-san much of my pathetic 
side either.

***ST02_00_00_02_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0043)
『Oh, right. Over these past few days, it seems 
like quite a few customers who'd heard the rumours 
started reserving Neko-chan.』

So she really did find other customers, huh.... 
And quite a few of them....

But I keep myself under control and don't let 
anything show in my voice or expression, and ask 
her calmly.

主人公
『Rumours...?』

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0044)
『She'd always been a shutin, never leaving her 
room, but for the past few days she's been showing 
up in the lobby.』

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0045)
『I wouldn't call them 'rumours', really... I just 
heard one of the customers who was there at the time 
talking about how the air around her's become much better.』

***ST02_00_00_02_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0046)
『About how it became a lot softer...』

主人公
『Went to the lobby, by herself....』

Just as she said, Neko-chan was always a girl who 
simply waited in her room, not caring a whit 
whether she got any customers or not.

Even when someone like me, who was a tiny bit close to 
her, booked her out, she never came to the door to 
receive me, or ever chatted with me outside in the lobby.

And yet....

I don't know whether it was because it pissed her off 
that I messed around with her to my heart's content and 
then stopped showing up, or whether she just got tired of me...

But did she really start looking for other 
customers all on her own....?

***ST02_01_00_02_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0047)
『That was when it began. Customers started coming 
back to her again. Apparently, her service is 
rated quite highly.』

***ST02_01_00_02_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0048)
『Seems like it spread by word of mouth to even 
those customers that were pushed away by her 
attitude long ago.』

Service rated highly.... every single word of hers 
does damage to me.

***ST02_00_00_01_02_00
兎萌(CH02_0049)
『This is all thanks to you too, isn't it, 
Onii-san? ...Let me say it again, thank you very 
much.』

主人公
『Ah, no....』

I feel bitter.

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0050)
『I felt very relieved when you were with her too 
but, since she's so busy now, I really don't have 
to worry about her anymore, do I?』

***ST02_01_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0051)
『Neko-chan coming to me everyday back then to 
complain and ask for advice almost seems like a 
dream. ...Ah, it's about time for me as well...』

A dream, huh? ...I'm the one who wants to believe 
this to be a dream.

Was I just deluding myself thinking that Neko-chan 
was opening up her heart to me...

***ST02_01_00_02_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0052)
『Until next time then. ...Ask for me one of these 
days too, okay? Fufuh~』

//兎萌立ち絵はけ
***ST02_01_00_02_01_05

Watching her back moving away from me, I stood 
there, dumbfounded by what I just heard.

***BGM_FadeOut

//黒暗転
***BGround_BG99_01

Either way, it's my turn tonight. ...Fuck, the 
fuck am I thinking! "My turn"? I've been coming 
here everyday just to make her mine and only mine.

In any case, there's no other option... I can only 
confirm with her directly, what she did with all 
those other men.

音瑚(CH01_0382)
『Ah, mister. You finally came to see me again? I was 
just starting to think that you were forcing yourself 
all this time, and finally couldn't do it anymore--』

Her tone and attitude are like always. For now, 
let's ask about what I just heard from Tomoe-san.

主人公
『...I heard that you've been going out to the 
lobby by yourself, lately.』

***ST01_20_00_00_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0383)
『W-What? What about it...?』

Seems like she didn't think she'd say it that 
softly. I stare at her anxious face.

***ST01_20_00_04_01_00
音瑚(CH01_0384)
『That's right. I did. But it's not like I was 
looking for you or anything, okay?』

主人公
『I see....』

So what Tomoe-san said was true, huh? Then the 
rest must have been....

***ST01_20_00_00_01_00
音瑚(CH01_0385)
『That aside! Why didn't you come at all these past 
few days? I was just about to forget you, you 
kn--...』

I'd been trying my best to keep looking at her 
face this whole time but, before I realized 
myself, I'd slumped my head down.

***ST01_20_00_06_06_00
音瑚(CH01_0386)
『H-Hey! W-What's wrong? That was a joke, obviously 
it was a joke! ...Hey, what happened? Tell me--!』

主人公
『A-Aah... sorry. I couldn't see you these past few 
days.』

***ST01_20_00_04_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0387)
『I-Isn't that your fault? You didn't come to see 
me at all. So...』

主人公
『So you looked for other customers in the lobby?』

***ST01_20_00_03_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0388)
『I didn't, dummy! When did I say that?!』

主人公
『I actually planned on coming yesterday. But you 
were completely booked out. Apparently, you were 
busy 'servicing' other men.』

***ST01_20_00_04_04_00
音瑚(CH01_0389)
『H-Hey! It's true that quite a few customers 
showed up, and I did keep them company but...』

主人公
『...So you did it with them, basically. Here.』

***ST01_20_00_04_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0390)
『Haah... I feel like you're misunderstanding 
something really badly...』

***ST01_20_00_03_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0391)
『It was just service, just regular old service! 
They were paying customers, so of course I chatted 
with them and stuff.』

***ST01_21_00_04_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0392)
『I didn't do any of the sort of, u-uhm... depraved 
stuff that you're thinking, mister. S-So relax.』

主人公
『W-Why...?』

***ST01_21_00_03_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0393)
『That's, uhm... because... uhm, ah... i-it's 
obvious, isn't it?!』

Obvious...? Her 'servicing' them by just chatting 
and not having sex...? That's... obvious?

***ST01_21_00_23_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0394)
『Jeez~~~... You're too dense, mister!!』

***ST01_21_00_23_06_00
音瑚(CH01_0395)
『Uhm, for stuff like that... I-I've already, made 
up my mind... t-to do it only with you. I-I 
decided that... on my own.』

Nn? Huh? ...Only with me? She...

主人公
『Decided that...?』

***ST01_21_00_23_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0396)
『T-That's right! I made up my mind, by myself! So, 
I've not had any sex with any other people, and I 
won't ever! Do you mind that?』

主人公
『N-No. Of course I don't... by any chance, were 
you waiting for me?』

Her red face looked even redder.

She nodded very head very slightly and then let 
out a small voice, as if mustering all she could.

***ST01_20_00_23_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0397)
『That's why I went out to the lobby too. It wasn't 
to attract other customers... I-I was looking 
for... uhm--... l-looking for you.』

***ST01_20_00_05_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0398)
『I said otherwise earlier but, you know... it's been a 
while since we've seen each other, so I felt shy... I 
didn't mean to lie and make you feel down... I'm sorry...』

***ST01_20_00_03_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0399)
『...Wuh, why am I the one apologizing! It's your 
fault for not coming to see me, you know.』

***ST01_20_00_04_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0400)
『And when you did come, you had a giant 
misunderstanding by yourself! Haah... I worried 
for nothing.』

主人公
『So you were worried, huh?』

***ST01_20_00_24_04_00
音瑚(CH01_0401)
『Nnnnnnnnnn~~!! ....Don't make me say any more 
embarrassing stuff, okay?!』

...Haah. So I was just pushing all my prejudice 
and misunderstandings onto her this whole time, 
huh?

My strength left me. All those unmanly things I 
just said all came back and seemed ridiculous in 
my head.

***ST01_20_00_23_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0402)
『I don't want you to ask me again and again later so I'll 
say it one last time, but even if I do let other customers 
book me, I don't do anything lewd or whatever else with them--!』

***ST01_20_00_04_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0403)
『I have standards too, you know... But I do have a 
lot of debt leftover still so I was just being 
hospitable, that's all! Do you get it?!』

主人公
『Y-Yeah. I got it, I got it.』

Being on the receiving end of her ferocity and 
being oppressed by her spirit, I could do nothing 
but nod.

At the same time, feeling her anxiety and unrest, 
I ended up laughing out a bit.

***ST01_20_00_03_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0404)
『To begin with, as long as you come daily, I won't 
have to deal with any other customers myself 
either, you know.』

***ST01_20_00_03_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0405)
『...What's with that face? Stop grinning like 
that... it's creepy!』

***ST01_21_00_05_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0406)
『...I was really lonely, you know? Once I started 
thinking that you might not come again, I couldn't 
stop myself, and I got really worried, okay?....』

***ST01_21_00_05_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0407)
『And if you don't come anymore, I... can't... 
h-have sex, either so...』

主人公
『You could have just done it with any other 
customer though?』

I realize that it's a bit cruel coming from the mouth 
of someone who was that depressed about it just a few 
moments ago, but I just couldn't help but tease her a bit.

***ST01_21_00_03_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0408)
『I told you, don't make me say it again!! I 
already made up my mind... you're the only one 
who's allowed to do that stuff to me, mister!』

主人公
『Then, wanna do it right now?』

***ST01_21_00_23_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0409)
『Nn---!! How can you even something like that so 
easily?!』

主人公
『Nnnn, is that a no for today then?』

I was completely back to being me.

She's been so flustered that she's not noticed 
yet, but my crotch is already rock hard.

***ST01_21_00_25_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0410)
『...N-No, I wanna do it... Ever since we had sex 
last, I've been, e-enduring it... D-Do me... 
okay?』

主人公
『Alright, I'll do it if you call me 'master'.』

***ST01_21_00_23_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0411)
『N-Not yet, not happening!』

Not yet, huh... But I guess that means she already 
thinks of me as her master, huh.... but if I say 
that out loud, she'll probably claw me.

***ST01_21_00_23_03_05

***BGM_FadeOut

//暗転
***BGround_BG99_01

I pulled her irritated, embarrassed self towards 
me, and hugged her hard. She smelled nice, like a 
woman.

And I dragged her off to bed. Her mouth kept 
running restlessly, but she didn't resist. If 
anything, she hugged me back.

I'll make her moan till she gives out today, and 
make her naturally... yet energetically call me 
her master.
