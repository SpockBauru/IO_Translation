"Come to see me again, okay?", she saw me out like 
she usually did, and I left.

『But that "again" never came again.』

Seems like she quit the club. From Neko-chan's 
mouth, seems like it was due to family 
circumstances...

In other words, seems like her husband had his 
work recognized, and was promptly shipped back 
home post-haste, where the company HQ is.

I think it's fine, as long as she's happy. I 
wanted to train her into being a bit more dirty 
and wild, but...

If I chase after her now, I'm just gonna be a 
stalker and nothing more. To begin with, 
"Tomoe-san" is just her stage name too.

I knew nothing about her, aside from the fact that 
she was a sexually frustrated housewife.

I was but a customer, and the woman that went by 
"Tomoe-san" was but one of the cast here, that I 
only knew for a short time.
