I left as usual, saying that I’d come back to play 
again.

『But "again" never came.』

Apparently, Tomoe-san quit Demi Cafe. According to 
Neko-chan, it was due to familial circumstances...

In other words, it seems that her husband, who had been 
working away for so long, was finally recognized for his 
work, and suddenly returned to the head office near here.

It’s fine if Tomoe-san is happy. I wanted to do 
more dirty and wild things with her, but...

If I chase after her now, I'd just be a stalker. 
To being with, the name Tomoe is also a stage 
name.

I didn't know anything about her other than that 
she was just an unsatisfied married woman.

I was just a customer, and she, who called herself 
Tomoe, was just a cast member I met at this club 
for a short time.
