Not bothering with the reception and any of the 
greeters, I carried my feet straight to the back 
of the lobby.

Ahead of me, there was a human figure standing 
there, a bit off the center of the path. Noticing 
me, she ran up to me with tiny steps.

音瑚(CH01_0105)
『I've been waiting for you.』

I thought she never left her room, so I was a bit 
surprised.

音瑚(CH01_0106)
『...You didn't come and knock at my door at the 
usual time so, I got worried...』

主人公
『That's rare, you always just wait for me in your 
room too, no matter how long I take. What's 
wrong?』

***ST01_41_00_05_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0107)
『S-Should I... not... have?』

Before I could say a single thing, she closed the distance and... 
didn't cling to me, which makes sense considering where we are, and 
instead quietly just stuck to my rear, as if trying to snuggle up to me.

***ST01_41_00_05_00_02
音瑚(CH01_0108)
『Those of us that... uhm, already have bookings are 
actually in the way of the other cast members and 
customers so, I really shouldn't be doing this... but.』

音瑚(CH01_0109)
『When I asked Tomoe-san about it, she said that 
since you didn't tell me not to, it was okay to do 
it just the one time atleast.』

***ST01_41_00_05_05_02
音瑚(CH01_0110)
『....But, uhm, should I... not have?』

With me quietly looking down at her from above, 
her already small voice got even smaller.

主人公
『No, it's fine.』

***ST01_41_00_02_01_00
音瑚(CH01_0111)
『Thank god.』

***ST01_41_00_01_01_00
音瑚(CH01_0112)
『It really is not allowed but, if you like it then 
I can do it everytime, master. Please let me do 
it!』

She stared at me straight with her big eyes, to 
the point that I almost couldn't remember the way 
she used to scowl at me.

***ST01_41_00_01_01_00
音瑚(CH01_0113)
『Erhm, it'd be embarrassing if any of the other 
girls see us like this so... let's quickly go to 
my room, master.』

Neko-chan took my arm and clung to it, as if to 
hug it, as if it was completely natural. And a 
nasty, mean thought came to my mind.

主人公
『Eh, I haven't decided who I'm gonna have fun with 
today though...』

//独立系から03の移行ありにポーズが飛ぶのでバシュってなるかも。

***ST01_30_00_06_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0114)
『Eh...』

I'd already called and booked Neko-chan for today, 
of course.

***ST01_30_00_05_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0115)
『Uhm, e-erhm... is it, not me today? I heard that 
you already put in a reservation...』

主人公
『Ah~, the staff might have misunderstood. I only 
booked a seat at the bar today, I was thinking of 
picking a cast member based on my mood instead.』

I don't know if it's due to the shock or what, but 
she didn't even realize that I was already walking 
towards her room to begin with.

***ST01_30_00_05_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0116)
『~~~~~~~....』

***ST01_30_00_05_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0117)
『I really thought... that you came for me today 
too... I see, so that's how it was...』

She let go of the arm she was holding between her 
chest.

***ST01_30_00_05_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0118)
『Uhm... why....』

主人公
『If I ordered you not to ask?』

***ST01_30_00_05_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0119)
『...!! ...o-obey--. I'll obey....』

Standing on the spot, she lost her heart, and 
dropped her shoulders.

From the side, it might have looked like that I 
was bullying and making one of the cast members 
cry in the lobby.

***ST01_30_00_05_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0120)
『Master, you can... pick whoever you want from all 
the girls here but... I... I only have you, my one 
and only master, you know...』

***ST01_30_00_01_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0121)
『....Please come see me, when you feel like it. 
Even if it's not today, I'll wait for you as long 
as it takes...』

Alright, that's enough teasing her for today. 
Things are gonna get boring if I declaw her too 
much, and there's no point in going further anyway.

主人公
『I was actually planning on heading straight to 
your room today, Neko-chan, but I just couldn't 
help but tease you a bit.』

***ST01_30_00_06_00_00
音瑚(CH01_0122)
『--!!!』

***ST01_30_00_23_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0123)
『Jeez, you meanie! I was seriously worried, you 
know!!』

I rein her in and pacify with using both my hands, 
her face red as a tomato.

主人公
『C'mon, you're being loud, you know.』

***ST01_30_00_23_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0124)
『--!! Come to my room already then! Please come!』

***BGM_FadeOut
***ST01_30_00_23_05_05


She quickly paced towards her room, still 
agitated, looking behind herself every so often to 
check that I was still following her.

The thought to stop in the middle did cross my 
mind but, it's gonna be annoying if she really 
does start crying so I scrapped it.

Finally, after she shut the door, she finally let go 
of the breath she was holding. The moment she sat her 
ass down on her usual spot, she started rattling on.

音瑚(CH01_0125)
『Jeez, don't shock me like that! You made me think 
that you weren't gonna come afterall. I really 
thought that I messed something up and made you mad, you know.』

***ST01_53_00_05_00_53
音瑚(CH01_0126)
『It really shocked me, you know... you dummy!!』

主人公
『I didn't think you'd get that depressed over it, 
so I was surprised too, honestly.』

The moment we got to her room, and she was finally 
sure that I was gonna stay for the day, her cheer 
returned to her.

***ST01_53_00_05_00_53
音瑚(CH01_0127)
『That's your fault, I came all the way out to the 
lobby to see you, and you said something like 
that.』

主人公
『But I'm free to play around with whoever I want, 
no?』

***ST01_53_00_05_05_53
音瑚(CH01_0128)
『Uuu... you are, but... But I was waiting for you. 
I already decided that you're my master so...』

主人公
『Are you saying that because of the debt?』

***ST01_53_00_05_05_53
音瑚(CH01_0129)
『N-No--!.... Of course, my job is my job but... 
you being my master has nothing to do with the 
money.』

主人公
『Why don't you try to act cuter then?』

***ST01_53_00_00_06_53
音瑚(CH01_0130)
『C-Cuter?! That's so sudden... h-how do I do it?』

主人公
『If I ordered you to figure that part out yourself 
too, then?』

***ST01_53_00_05_05_53
音瑚(CH01_0131)
『...--!』

***ST01_53_00_04_05_53
音瑚(CH01_0132)
『I'll... I'll do it...』

She said that, and suddenly stood up.

主人公
『Orders are absolute, huh?』

***ST01_30_00_04_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0133)
『Y-Yeah....』

主人公
『Think over what you want me to do to you today 
then. And that's an order.』

***ST01_31_00_04_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0134)
『...Please give your Neko... lots of orders like 
that today too... and play with her lots.』

主人公
『Alright, then let's do just that.』

***ST01_31_00_02_01_00
音瑚(CH01_0135)
『O-Okay....』
