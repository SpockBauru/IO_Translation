音瑚
『.........』


and it's exactly as I predicted.

It's probably because I'm generously giving the 
club money almost every day, no matter what 
Neko-chan says to the staff.

It’s proof that Demi Cafe accepts me as a 
customer. And I have to make her realize that.

音瑚(CH01_0067)
『Ugh! The nerve you have coming in here after what 
you did!』

音瑚(CH01_0068)
『Turns out you’re just like all the others! No, 
you’re the worst of them all!』

I thought she would be too depressed to talk.

...But I guess she’s fine if she has enough energy 
to be this ferocious.

音瑚(CH01_0069)
『What are you so quiet for?! Say something!』

主人公
『I just got here and now you want me to leave?』

音瑚(CH01_0070)
『Obviously! You know what you did, right?!』

主人公
『Yeah. I get it, it's normal to be angry about 
it.』

音瑚(CH01_0071)
『Then get out...』

***BGM_Sweet_&amp_Horror

主人公
『Okay, I’ll leave, but you do know that I always 
chose you and ordered all kinds of expensive 
things, right?』

She stares and interrupts before I finish talking.

音瑚(CH01_0072)
『S...so what...』

No matter how naive and energetic she may be, she 
seems to be aware of the implications.

主人公
『What do you think would happen if I stopped 
asking for you?』

***ST01_50_00_03_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0073)
『I’d be relieved. I don't want to see your face. 
It would be one less trouble in my life...』

主人公
『At the very least, you won’t be able to stay here 
anymore. It's not a place that keeps girls who 
have no customers and don't make money.』

音瑚(CH01_0074)
『Well, I can just go to another club...』

主人公
『You embarrassed a person famous in this industry. 
Demi Cafe will absolutely have you take 
responsibility for it.』

主人公
『The next place you’ll be sent to will be more 
real and hard. You'll be treated worse than what 
happened yesterday...'』

***ST01_50_00_03_00_50
音瑚(CH01_0075)
『...』

Even though she’s staring at me, somehow I feel 
like her ambition has disappeared.

主人公
『So like I said, I'll keep choosing you to make 
you the best girl here.』

音瑚(CH01_0076)
『...No.』

She knows she has to entertain me no matter how 
much she hates to.

主人公
『The club welcomes me to be your master. I wonder 
if you understand what that means you need to 
do.''』

I approach and reach out.

***ST01_50_00_03_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0077)
『No! Stay away, pervert! Gross!''』

主人公
『It hurt before because it was your first time. 
I'll be gentle today, so it’ll feel much more 
better.''』

***ST01_50_00_03_03_50
音瑚(CH01_0078)
『Sh, shut up! Shut up! Shut up!''』

主人公
『Did you think about it? Fantasized about it...? ]』

***ST01_50_23_03_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0079)
『N, no! I…I don’t want to have sex!''』

主人公
『You’re right. We shouldn’t rush things. Well 
then, let's order something to bring up your 
sales.''』

***ST01_50_00_03_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0080)
『I don't want anything! Go ahead and order. I 
won't drink or eat any of it!''』

主人公
『That's fine. Let's spend the rest of the time on 
plenty of service then.』

***ST01_50_00_06_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0081)
『Wh, what?''』

主人公
『I’ll tell the staff I won’t be coming back because 
Neko-chan wouldn’t serve me at all. It's too bad 
Neko-chan will be roughed up again by guys other than me...''』

***ST01_50_00_05_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0082)
『I don’t want anything to do with sex, neither 
with you or with any other guy...!''』

主人公
『You say that, but that might not work if you were 
sold to another club. There are places that cater 
to perverts who enjoy girls pain.''』

***ST01_50_00_06_00_50
音瑚(CH01_0083)
『What...』

Her face got splashed with the color of unease. 
Seeing such a reaction gets me excited.

***ST01_50_00_06_00_50
音瑚(CH01_0084)
『There’s no way such a place exists...right?』

I shake my head.

主人公
『Customers at such places become more delighted the more 
the girls become unwilling. I bet everyone there would 
get extremely excited if they saw you crying and screaming.』

***ST01_50_00_05_00_50
音瑚
『.........』

主人公
『Even I can't bear to see that happen to you. I 
just want to spend a good time with you, so I 
won’t do anything absurd…Please, relax.』

Although she snapped at me and rattled on and on, 
just like magic, her eyes drifted into anxiety.

It looks like she understands both of our 
positions.

***ST01_50_00_05_03_50
音瑚(CH01_0085)
『You’re such a coward...』
