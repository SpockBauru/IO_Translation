The next day, I went to the club again.

音瑚
『.................』


Yep, I expected nothing less.

Even if Neko-chan went to the staff to complain, 
I've been opening my wallet here generously 
everyday.

It's proof that the Demi Stage Cafe accepts me as 
one of its customers. I gotta make her understand 
that.

音瑚(CH01_0067)
『--...!! The nerve you have, walking in here so 
shamelessly after what you did--!!』

音瑚(CH01_0068)
『You really are just the same as every other 
customer that's tried to do weird stuff to me! 
...No, you're the worst of them all!!』

And here I thought she might have been too 
depressed to even open her mouth.

...But if she still has enough energy to scowl at 
me like this, then she'll probably be fine.

音瑚(CH01_0069)
『Why're you so quiet--!! Say something!』

主人公
『I just got here, are you telling me to leave or 
something?』

音瑚(CH01_0070)
『--! Of course I am!! You understand what you did 
to me, right?!!』

主人公
『Yep. I get that you're mad too, I don't really 
mind that.』

音瑚(CH01_0071)
『Then, get ou--....』

***BGM_Sweet_&amp_Horror

主人公
『Sure but, I've been coming here for you everyday 
and ordering tons of stuff in your name... you get 
that, right?』

Before she's finished, I put on my best glare and 
cut her off.

音瑚(CH01_0072)
『--!... W-What about it....』

Seems like she understands what I mean, no matter 
how naive or innocent she always tries to be.

主人公
『What do you think would happen, if I stopped 
doing that?』

***ST01_50_00_03_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0073)
『What'... It'd be a big relief to me. I don't want 
to even look at your face. If I never saw it 
again, it'd be too...』

主人公
『At the very least, you probably won't be able to 
stay here. This ain't the sort of place that'd 
shelter a girl that brings in no money and no customers.』

音瑚(CH01_0074)
『I-It doesn't have to be here, I could always go 
to another....』

主人公
『You made a VIP of this industry lose a lot of 
face. I wouldn't be surprised if Demi Stage Cafe 
was forced to make you take responsibility.』

主人公
『You'll probably be sold off to a whole lot more 
serious and hard place, you know? They'll probably 
do much more horrible stuff to you than I did~....』

***ST01_50_00_03_00_50
音瑚(CH01_0075)
『--!.....』

Her scowl's as hard as ever, but I feel like a bit 
of her dogged spirit just left her.

主人公
『That's why, I'll keep booking you everyday, and 
make you the best girl here.』

音瑚(CH01_0076)
『...No way.』

Whether she hates it or what, she should 
understand that she has no choice other than to 
entertain me.

主人公
『This club is welcoming me with open arms, 
Neko-chan. To be your master, that is. You 
probably know what you have to do in that case, no?』

I get closer, and reach out my hands.

***ST01_50_00_03_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0077)
『No--! Don't come closer--!! You pervert--! You 
disgust me!!』

主人公
『Last time hurt a lot, didn't it? It was your 
first time, that's why. I'll be a lot more gentle 
today so it'll feel a whole lot better, Neko-chan.』

***ST01_50_00_03_03_50
音瑚(CH01_0078)
『S-Shut up! Shut up shut up--!!』

主人公
『Did you just think back to it? Imagine it in your 
head...?』

***ST01_50_23_03_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0079)
『N-No, I did not! ...I-I do... do not... want to 
have sex, at all--!』

主人公
『True. We don't need to rush things... for now, 
let's order something so that your sales go up.』

***ST01_50_00_03_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0080)
『I don't want anything at all--!! Even if you 
order it, I won't drink anything, nor will I eat 
anything!!』

主人公
『Whatever you say. Then, let's just spend the rest 
of our remaining time together on regular 
service.』

***ST01_50_00_06_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0081)
『H-Haah--?』

主人公
『I'll tell the staff later, that I won't be coming 
back since you don't 'serve' me at all. It's a shame 
that some other guy will end up roughing you up~...』

***ST01_50_00_05_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0082)
『It doesn't matter if it's you or some other guy, 
I'm not doing that stuff anymore...!』

主人公
『You say that but, you might not be able to do anything about 
it with just that. There's lots of clubs out there that 
specially cater to the sort of perverts that enjoy seeing girls in pain.』

***ST01_50_00_06_00_50
音瑚(CH01_0083)
『Eh--....』

Unease so sharp that even I could see it clearly 
filled her face. Seeing those sorts of reactions 
from her arouse me a whole lot too now.

***ST01_50_00_06_00_50
音瑚(CH01_0084)
『T-There couldn't... possibly be a place like 
that... right?』

I shake my head.

主人公
『The customers that go to places like that feel raw 
pleasure from seeing girls hate it. Considering you're 
the type to cry and scream too, you'd probably make a smash hit.』

***ST01_50_00_05_00_50
音瑚
『.................』

主人公
『Personally, I can't accept that either. I just 
want to spend my every evening having fun together 
with you, Neko-chan, not force you. ...So relax.』

Her gaze became anxious and unsteady, if all that 
bite until now was just my imagination.

Seems like she understands now, just where she and 
I stand.

***ST01_50_00_05_03_50
音瑚(CH01_0085)
『You're just, playing dirty...』
