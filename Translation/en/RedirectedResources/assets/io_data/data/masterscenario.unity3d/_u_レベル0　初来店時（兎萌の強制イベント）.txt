I was very much expecting to get off work late 
today but, somehow it all got done sooner than I 
thought.

When I checked the time, it actually ended up 
being slightly earlier than usual. I've got 
nothing else to do either.

...I'm bored. ...But, I didn't book Neko-chan for 
today either, since I thought I'd be late.

But it's not like I've got anywhere else to kill 
time either. It is what it is, I'll just go hit up 
the club.

『Our apologies. Neko isn't in today...』

主人公
『Ah, no. I didn't put in a reservation myself 
so...』

When I asked at the reception, I was told she was 
off today. But I don't sense any sort of anxiety 
either, like during that whole VIP incident.

It's probably nothing more than her taking the 
chance to take a day off when she can, considering 
I normally book everyday and don't give her any time off.

I came here on the off-chance she was in but, it 
is what it is. Let's leave before they try to push 
another girl onto me.

『Oh my~』

主人公
『Ah...』

兎萌(CH02_0072)
『I see we meet again, hello.』

主人公
『Tomoe-san, was it?』

兎萌(CH02_0073)
『Yes. You remembered my name, I see. Huhuh, I'm 
glad.』

I've seen cast members come and go from the lobby 
to their rooms before, a few times.

Seems like most of them are about Neko-chan's age, 
or in some cases just a bit older than her.

There's not many that look as old and mature as 
Tomoe-san here, so she leaves a real impression.

And what's more... on top of her beauty and sex 
appeal, she even went out of her way to explain 
the points system to me, so there's no way I'd forget.

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0074)
『If I recall correctly, Neko-chan's off today... 
Did you come to have fun with another girl?』

主人公
『Ah, no. I was supposed to get off work late 
today, but somehow it cleared up early so... I 
didn't put in a reservation.』

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0075)
『I see. With how busy your reservations keep her 
everyday, she's been told to make the best of her 
days off, you know?』

***ST02_00_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0076)
『I mean, she's been so busy lately that ever since 
that incident, I haven't even gotten the chance to 
talk to her for more than a few minutes.』

***ST02_00_00_02_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0077)
『Huhuh, you treat her so well. Thank you.』

The way her soft tone and words were so utterly 
different from Neko-chan's made my heart throb.

主人公
『Are you perhaps waiting for someone right 
now...?』

***ST02_01_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0078)
『No. It's still early today, and I just cannot 
stand being alone in that room myself... so I came 
out here. I feel a lot less lonely here.』

***ST02_01_00_00_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0079)
『Wuh, huhuh. I ended up holding Neko-chan's 
benefactor up in the lobby again... Let's see, how 
about we go to my room?』

主人公
『Eh...』

***ST02_01_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0080)
『I want to thank you, for always looking after 
her.』

Benefactor', and thank me... Seems like she didn't 
tell her, that I pushed her down and forced it on 
her.

It's not like I need to go home right now anyway, 
I can chat with her a little bit. Who knows, I 
might get to hear some new information this time.

主人公
『Then, just for a bit... is that alright?』

***ST02_01_00_02_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0081)
『Yes. I'll go tell the staff then. Don't worry 
about the fees or anything, I'll tell them it's on 
me.』

//兎萌立ち絵はけ

She told me which rooms was hers, and then almost 
hopped and skipped her way happily to the 
reception.

***BGM_FadeOut

Neko-chan's my favourite, but she gets my heart 
racing too.

//黒背景

Her room was more or less the same as Neko-chan's, 
bearing the same layout, but the scent in the air was 
somehow a bit different, making it feel entirely novel.

And between all that, in a move that was completely the opposite 
of Neko-chan, she went out of her way to order drinks for me, and 
even brought up inoffensive small talk to start the conversation.

What I didn't expect, was for her to be quite the 
alcohol lover. She got pretty drunk and looked 
like she was enjoying herself.

『And then... oh my, you're already out. I'll order 
more. It doesn't matter if you drink it or not, 
really. What should I go for...』

主人公
『You really don't need to, Tomoe-san... I'm quite 
used to dealing with Neko-chan, you see, so if 
anything, this is making me nervous.』

Is what I'm saying, but really... she's gone through 
two glasses already, and even if they were light 
cocktails, she's gonna go from tipsy to drunk real soon.

***ST02_30_00_25_05_30
兎萌(CH02_0083)
『I told you, don't worry about the money~... 
Jeez~. Just one more, okay?』

It's hard to say no to that face. To begin with, 
she's entertaining me, I'm not even the one 
paying. So time to just smile and nod.

主人公
『Yes, then please. By the way, about what we were 
talking earlier, about Neko-chan's friends.』

主人公
『Is it really true, does she really not get along 
with anyone else here? Even the cast?』

***ST02_30_00_20_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0084)
『Yeah~. I don't really see her talking to girls of 
her generation all that much, and even when she 
does, it's usually about work....』

***ST02_30_00_20_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0085)
『I've never seen her talk about or get excited 
about something personal with anyone~』

If I could have found someone aside from Tomoe-san 
who knew anything about Neko-chan

I wouldn't have minded booking them for a night 
but, from what she's saying, I don't think that's 
gonna work out.

***ST02_30_00_20_05_30
兎萌(CH02_0086)
『Unlike me, it seems like Neko-chan doesn't really 
ever get lonely. I don't know whether it's her age, 
or her personality... Honestly, I'm a bit envious.』


主人公
『Hahah, even a customer like me is probably 
nothing more than a nuisance to her.』

***ST02_30_00_25_04_30
兎萌(CH02_0087)
『Jeez~, onii-san. You keep talking on and on about 
Neko-chan~. You're gonna make me jealous.』

That made me do a double take. She's being so 
accommodating that I ended up talking about 
nothing but her.

***ST02_30_00_22_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0088)
『I'm kidding. It's true that I do feel a bit jealous 
but... I feel less lonely talking to you like this, and 
it's not like I've ever told you much about myself either.』

The aura around her changed so suddenly I couldn't 
help but stare.

***ST02_30_00_25_00_30
兎萌(CH02_0089)
『Haah... If only my husband was as caring and 
singleminded about me as you are about 
Neko-chan...』

主人公
『Eh...』

Husband, is she... referring to a customer here? 
No way, to begin with, it wouldn't fit the 
context.

***ST02_30_00_21_02_30
兎萌(CH02_0090)
『Uffufuh... You look like a deer in headlights. I 
don't mind telling you, but only because you're 
Neko-chan's main client, okay? ... The truth is, I...』

Married, she said, while miming a ring on her left 
hand ring finger with her right hand.

I imagine she takes it off during work hours.

***ST02_30_00_22_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0091)
『I only told you this because you're you, so don't 
tell anyone, okay? Fufuh--』

主人公
『O-Okay....』

I still don't know why she's working here but, 
suddenly she seemed a whole lot more sexier. She's 
someone's wife, huh....

As if reading the air, even before the thought 
left my head, she'd place her hand on my thighs, 
and scooched closer to me.

***ST02_30_00_21_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0092)
『Hey... it's just a, guess on my end but, you've 
already done that with Neko-chan, right?』

主人公
『'T-That'...?』

***ST02_30_00_22_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0093)
『Fufuh, 'service', what else? Of course, the stuff 
they don't put on the menu... It's just my 
intuition but, I have a feling that you have.』

主人公
『Isn't the 'service' here...』

more or less just doing the deed...?

***ST02_30_00_27_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0094)
『Yep... it's sex. You're a smooth worker, 
onii-san, being able to seduce someone like 
Neko-chan.』

***ST02_30_00_25_00_30
兎萌(CH02_0095)
『I'm sorry for asking something so weird. But it's 
been quite a while for me so, haah... I'm 
envious~』

That's unexpected. Someone as attractive as her? 
With a body like that?

That thought ended up writing itself on my face. 
And I couldn't help but lick her over with my 
eyes.

***ST02_30_00_22_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0096)
『Fufuh, you look surprised. ...That makes me 
pretty happy, honestly. For what it's worth, I am 
someone else's, so with clients... I always try to...』

***ST02_30_00_25_05_30
兎萌(CH02_0097)
『Limit it to just my mouth and chest, really. It 
just so happens that all my clients are more into 
that anyway.』

So... nobody's ravished her down there in a long 
while, to the point that she's hungry for it. Not 
her clients, not even her husband.

Suddenly, I became very conscious of her hot, 
alcohol stained scent and breath hitting my face, 
and my crotch started reacting.

***ST02_30_00_25_00_30
兎萌(CH02_0098)
『I satisfy them completely with my mouth and chest 
so, they never ask for anything beyond that....』

主人公
『B-But at home, your husband should...』

I gulped down my endless saliva, while laying my 
gaze on her chest and crotch.

***ST02_30_00_25_00_30
兎萌(CH02_0099)
『...He's been away from home for a long time now, 
due to work. So it's always just me at home. All 
by myself.』

Behind that tipsy smile, I could feel a deep 
loneliness stabbing through her heart.

And clearly, her body's needs are too much for her 
to handle. Even if she's married, that probably 
happened at quite the young age.

***ST02_30_00_22_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0100)
『But I still love my husband dearly, you know? 
Even if he's not here.』

主人公
『Then, why do you work here of all places....?』

I ended up blurting out what I was thinking word 
for word.

***ST02_30_00_20_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0101)
『Are you really gonna ask me that?』

Leaning forward, she put her hands on my thighs.

主人公
『Ah, no, erhm...』

***ST02_30_00_25_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0102)
『My husband, you see... he's back to being a 
salaryman now but, a while ago... he tried to 
start a small business, but it didn't work out.』

***ST02_30_00_21_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0103)
『At that time, to help with the finances, I started 
working part time too... and when I was looking for 
some well paid work, someone introduced me to this place.』

***ST02_30_00_20_01_30
兎萌(CH02_0104)
『At first, I wasn't aware at all that this was 
that sort of a place but... I don't feel lonely 
working here so, it might just be perfect for me.』

Her hands kept touching more and more, and I felt 
strong passion from her. Since she's a rabbit, would 
you call this 'estrus'?... I'm starting to lose my self control.

主人公
『Uhm, if you go any further, I'll....』

***ST02_30_00_25_06_30
兎萌(CH02_0105)
『I want to thank you, so it's fine. Just once, 
just for today... Let me serve you, thoroughly...』

Loneliness overflowing out of her, she closed the 
distance between us, her eyes drunk with more than just 
alcohol, and I held her on the spot, with my dick rock hard.
