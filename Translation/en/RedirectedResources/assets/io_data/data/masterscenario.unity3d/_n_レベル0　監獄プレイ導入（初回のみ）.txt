I headed to the store early today and reserved a 
special room.

I had an order that I had to get through to the 
cheeky Neko-chan, and in order to do that I needed 
to rent this room.

It's a pretty maniacal play, but it's a great way 
to discipline and humiliate Neko-chan now.

Neko-chan looks as grumpy as ever. Hopefully this 
will make her a little more obedient.

Either way, I can't wait to see what she looks 
like. Let's give it a shot.

主人公
『Hey, Neko-chan.』

音瑚(CH01_0600)
『What?』

主人公
『I have a suggestion.』

音瑚(CH01_0601)
『Yes.』

I ordered a drink, but she just looked at it and 
didn't take a sip. The drink was getting lukewarm 
on the table.

主人公
『From now on, we're not going to fuck in this 
room, but... well...』

I ponder how I can elicit a strong rejection.

主人公
『It's probably the busiest time of the day, so 
let's fuck in the crowded lobby in front of 
everyone.』

***ST01_50_00_06_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0602)
『What?』

主人公
『I know you're probably surprised, but I want to do 
this for Neko-chan more than I want to do it for 
myself.』

***ST01_50_00_03_03_50
音瑚(CH01_0603)
『'Why is that my...' I don't get it at all!　Stop 
with the sick jokes!』

主人公
『I'm not kidding, I'm serious. I'm not kidding, I'm 
serious. ...You've never fucked any of your 
customers before.』

主人公
『I'm sure you'll be happy to know that Neko-chan 
has finally grown up enough to suck a client's 
cock all the way to the root.』

主人公
『I'm sure the customers who have been away will 
come back to make reservations.』

Before I had even finished, she was staring at me 
as if she was going to jump on me.

主人公
『If I do that, I think I'll be able to pay off the 
debt Neko-chan is in trouble with sooner...』

音瑚(CH01_0604)
『Are you out of your mind?』

I know that Neko-chan will be angry like this.

主人公
『I really want to monopolize Neko-chan, but 
considering her welfare, I think it's better to do 
this.』

Of course, I'm going to keep Neko-chan to myself.

I found myself laughing at the transparent, 
flippant lie that it was PR for other men.

***ST01_50_00_03_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0605)
『I don't care how much trouble I'm in I'm not going 
to go along with such a crazy proposal!』


However, Neko-chan was so caught up in the content 
of my proposal that she didn't notice my 
intentions in the slightest.

***ST01_50_00_03_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0606)
『I've put up with you long enough, but leave me 
alone.』

***BGM_FadeOut


主人公
『Are you sure you can't drink this suggestion?』

***BGM_不穏な空気

***ST01_50_00_03_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0607)
『What the hell is going on? How many times do I 
have to say no before you'll understand?』

主人公
『Huh... dropping a lot of money on a girl with 
such a bad attitude...』

主人公
『I'm the one who's making it possible for you to 
pay off your debt now, remember?』

***ST01_50_00_03_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0608)
『I know that, I know that, but I don't want to be 
in the lobby, I can't! You're too persistent.』

主人公
『You know what I'm talking about, but you can't 
listen to me?』

***ST01_50_00_03_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0609)
『You're so persistent! I can't do it, no matter 
what. I don't even like regular sex, so there's no 
way I can do that.』

Yes, I dumped something I couldn't possibly do, so 
it was completely natural for it to go this way. 
This is good.

主人公
『Oh, I see... you don't like it that much...』

***ST01_50_00_03_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0610)
『Of course.』

主人公
『You know your position, but you still say you 
can't or won't or whatever...』

As I stared at her, I saw a hint of anxiety in her 
face, which had always been angry.

***ST01_50_00_03_04_50
音瑚(CH01_0611)
『So, what the hell... I don't know what to say...』

Normally, after a couple of exchanges, I would 
shut up. Even Neko-chan seemed to have noticed 
that the flow was strange.

主人公
『If you can't follow me that far, I'll just have 
to take you there...』

***ST01_50_00_04_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0612)
『Oh, what's that place...I'd never go there if it 
was a lobby.』

In the first place, I even mistook the demi-cafe 
for a high-end maid cafe or something.

she probably didn't even know that place existed.

主人公
『'Hmm, I still think Robbie's better, don't you?』

***ST01_50_00_03_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0613)
『I told you I'm not going! You're an idiot!』

主人公
『I'm sorry, but you have a bad mouth. Well, I'll 
fix your lisp there too, but...』

***ST01_50_00_04_05_50
音瑚(CH01_0614)
『... Damn it, that's why I've been... I don't know 
what you're talking about.』

Neko-chan looked back at me suspiciously. But I'm 
not going to reassure her or comfort her.

主人公
『I don't want my favors to be neglected, so...　I'm 
sorry, but come on, stand up.』

***ST01_50_00_06_06_50
音瑚(CH01_0615)
『No, no, no. What a pity. Where do you think 
you're going?』

主人公
『It's in the store, not the lobby. If you don't listen to 
me, I'll call the staff. If you don't listen to me, I'll 
call the staff, and I'm sure they'll send some right away.』

主人公
『I think it's better to follow me and go quietly 
than to be held down and taken away.』

***FadeInBlack

Then Neko-chan stood up, though she glared hard at 
me.

I wondered if she felt a little more comfortable 
knowing that she was in a store and that the staff 
knew her.

Still, my body was terribly tense.

she urged her to leave the room.

From there, I stood ahead of her as if escorting 
her down the hallway and detoured toward the 
stairs at the back of the lobby.

***BGM_FadeOut

Then she went downstairs.


It was no longer the corridor of an exclusive 
club, but rather a corridor of inorganic concrete 
walls.

//SE ドサ音

***SE_tumbling1

I opened the door to one of the rooms in the space 
beyond, let Neko-chan in as if I were halfway 
pushing her out, and locked the door behind her.

『It's not good... What the hell is this place?』

主人公
『This is one of the service rooms Demi-Cafe 
provides.』

The air was chilly and smelled humid, as if it 
were underground.

The dim lighting, the sturdy construction of the 
jail, and the facilities inside the jail are all 
just like a real jail from a long time ago.

***ST01_01_00_03_03_00
音瑚(CH01_0617)
『This service... is not a prison, no matter how 
you look at it!』

主人公
『...here, with the consent of the guest and the 
cast, such play is allowed...』

主人公
『They say you can use it to punish cast members 
who don't listen to you.　Or you can use it to 
train them.』

***ST01_01_00_03_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0618)
『You're kidding...』

主人公
『If you think I'm joking, why don't you take a 
look around and see what we have in store for 
you?』

I looked fearfully into the bars and around them, 
at what was in this space, and heard a shuddering, 
spitting sound.

主人公
『'Come on, get inside. If you don't listen to me, 
I'm going to have to rough you up... and you don't 
want to get hurt, do you?』

From the tools available for restraint, she picked 
up a rope and motioned with a chin tuck to head 
into the bars.

***ST01_00_00_05_05_00
音瑚(CH01_0619)
『Oh, please don't tie me up. And I will listen to 
you from now on... so get me out of here and back 
to my room.』

主人公
『'I'll try to listen to you, there's no reason to 
bring it back.　Besides, it could be a one-time 
lie, and it's too late for that now.』

I laughed at the difference between my 
misunderstanding in the room and my current 
attitude.

***ST01_00_00_03_06_00
音瑚(CH01_0620)
『No, I'm not lying! What are you laughing at?』

主人公
『It's too loud to be heard... just get inside.』

I grabbed her by the shoulders and pushed her into 
the bars. The atmosphere in this room affected me 
to be a little rough.

//暗転

***ST01_00_00_06_06_00
音瑚(CH01_0621)
『Hey! Don't tie me up. Don't... don't do that!　I 
said stop it!』

主人公
『I've done a bit of research on how to tie her up, 
but I'm not sure I can keep her from getting hurt if 
she gets out of control, so I'll just hold her still...』

***ST01_01_00_05_06_00
音瑚(CH01_0622)
『No, no, no, no! No! No! Stop it!』

音瑚(CH01_0623)
『What are you doing?』

主人公
『If you keep sugar coating your face, you'll never 
listen to me.』

音瑚(CH01_0624)
『I didn't do anything wrong but I demanded things 
from you that you couldn't even do.』

音瑚(CH01_0625)
『You just wanted to do this, you pervert!』

主人公
『'Yes, yes. The more you say, the more you can't 
imagine what will happen.』

主人公
『And I think Neko-chan is the one who will become a pervert. 
I think you're the one who's going to become a pervert, 
because you're going to become a sow that's suited to the pigsty.』

音瑚(CH01_0626)
『What are you talking about?』

主人公
『So let's hear a lot of good moaning.』
