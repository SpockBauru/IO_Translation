『Right now, I'm at the club「Demi Stage Cafe」』

I come here on my way home from work, to soothe my 
daily pains. Then again, I say that, but I've only 
come here three times so far.

I came across info about it online, and while the 
ticket price was much higher than other clubs, I 
still checked it out.

Because, according to the rumours, if you become a regular 
and get along well with the hostesses, stuff much more... 
shall we say, depraved than other clubs becomes a possibility.

...In the end, it's still just a rumour, but one 
of the girls instantly caught my eye when I first 
came here.

//立ち絵表示
***BGround_BG03_01

That girl? Neko-chan.

Just like the club name, the names of all the 
hostesses are likely connected to them, in one way 
or another, what with them all being demi-humans.

The staff recommended her, so I went for it. And 
the girl that showed up? Even cuter than the 
photo.

Anyways, point being, she towered so much above 
all the others, and more than anything else, she 
was straight up my type.

//立ち絵終わり
***BGround_BG01_01


It's just... and she'd probably get pretty ticked off if 
I said this to her face but, she really is just like a 
cat... She refuses to let her guard down near me, at all.

But, I want to get close to her. I want to snuggle 
up to her as she calls me 'master' and pours a 
drink for me.

//黒背景
***BGround_BG99_01
***BGM_FadeOut

As usual, I'd already booked her out in advance, 
so it didn't take long at the counter at all. Time 
to head to her room.

音瑚(CH01_0000)
『Welcome... Thank you for coming to see me today.』

She came all the way to welcome me at the door, 
this time. But it's my third visit and she still 
hasn't shown me any energy at all.

主人公
『It's me again... should I not have?』

***ST01_00_00_04_00_00


音瑚(CH01_0001)
『Eh... why? I-It's nothing like that. I am pretty 
happy that you came to see me...』

主人公
『Your tail... you're shaking it left and right. 
....If I remember right, cats only do that when 
they're in a bad mood, no?』

***ST01_00_00_03_03_00

音瑚(CH01_0002)
『Wha--... Jeez! It's not for you to look at!』

A dress that shows off the bodyline. Skin so taut 
and young, water would roll off it.

主人公
『I came here to enjoy myself with you today, so 
cheer up, c'mon. I'm happy to see you again, 
Neko-chan.』

***ST01_00_00_04_03_00

音瑚(CH01_0003)
『...O-Okay, fine. But don't stare, okay?』

***ST01_00_00_01_05_00

音瑚(CH01_0004)
『Nnn... I still can't get used to greeting people. 
But they told me to absolutely do it, if someone 
ever comes to see me.』

Unlike my first visit, she's slowly opening up bit 
by bit, and becoming grumbly.

主人公
『You're so serious, Neko-chan. It's not the first 
time I've come though, so just take it easy.』

***ST01_00_00_01_05_00

音瑚(CH01_0005)
『Nn~.... even if you tell me to... I still haven't been 
here long... and it's the first time I'm doing this kind 
of job, so I don't know what sort of flowery words to say.』

主人公
『You really don't need to. I just want to get 
along lots with you, so you can just take it easy 
yourself too.』

***ST01_01_00_03_05_00

音瑚(CH01_0006)
『I'm not sure why you care so much about the mood 
of a cast member. Haah... your head's probably 
full of lewd stuff anyway, no?』

Well, yeah. I can't deny that. But your sighs 
wound my comfort craving heart...

//ＳＥ：ドアのノック音

***SE_door_09_knock
***ST01_01_00_00_00_00

主人公
『Neko-chan, you wound me with your sighs... ah, 
they brought the drinks.』

音瑚(CH01_0007)
『Sorry, I know you went out of your way to order 
for me, but alcohol and I don't....』

主人公
『I know. You don't like alcohol, right?』

I want her to open her heart to me, even just a 
bit. To that end, I'm trying to gentlemanly reach 
out to her myself.

***ST01_50_00_00_00_50

I pick up the glass of juice I ordered, and hand it to 
Neko-chan. Still suspicious that it's alcohol, she gives 
it a good sniff before she finally brings it to her mouth.

音瑚(CH01_0008)
『*sip*....』

主人公
『.................』

音瑚
『.................』

She's really engrossed in the drink. ...Wonder if 
she feels a bit more cheery now? Let's see, can I 
close in on this distance...?

***ST01_50_00_04_00_50

音瑚(CH01_0009)
『Uhm~....』

主人公
『Eh! Ah, I haven't done anything yet though?!』

***ST01_50_00_03_04_50

音瑚(CH01_0010)
『....--! Were you planning on doing something? 
Heck, stop staring like that... it's really hard 
to drink like this.』

I sat my hips back down on the couch. ...It was 
the perfect chance to get beside her too.

音瑚(CH01_0011)
『...Nnnnn~』

Damn, those are some distrustful eyes. No other 
choice, I gotta lie and smooth things over.

主人公
『No, well, you were just drinking it so 
deliciously, I just couldn't take my eyes off 
you.』

***ST01_50_00_00_00_50

音瑚(CH01_0012)
『I guess that's okay then.』

I can see her thighs from the corner of my eyes. If I 
could just sit next to her, I might be able to brush up 
my legs against hers and brush it off as an accident...

...But I guess that's not happening, I just made 
her suspicious of me.

音瑚(CH01_0013)
『Thanks for the drink. I'll take the glasses 
away.』

//音瑚立ち絵一旦はけ
***ST01_05_00_00_00_05

And because of that, she took the glasses away 
herself. What a tough shield.

I wonder, have any customers managed to get past 
her rock solid guard and flirted with her 
before.... I chase her with my eyes.

//音瑚立ち絵戻り
***ST01_00_00_00_00_00
***BGround3D_BG00_01


音瑚(CH01_0014)
『W-What... what's with that look...』

主人公
『Nothing, it's just, you really don't go out of your way to 
talk to me... so I was wondering there's any particular 
customers of yours that you make an exception for and get along with.』

I realize I probably come off as too direct and 
pigheaded, but I'm genuinely curious.

***ST01_00_00_04_00_00

音瑚(CH01_0015)
『Exception? Get along with? The heck's that mean? 
To begin with, this is a cafe bar, no?』

音瑚(CH01_0016)
『It's just a more mature version of a maid cafe, 
nothing more... t-the outfits being what they 
are.』

***ST01_00_00_04_00_00

音瑚(CH01_0017)
『In the end, it's just a cafe where you can have a 
light meal while having a chat with a girl, 
nothing more.』

***ST01_00_00_00_00_00

音瑚(CH01_0018)
『So I don't really go out of my way to get along 
with any specific customers.』

The matter-of-fact reply really caught me 
off-guard. Seems like she really does think that 
this is a wholesome, if mature, cafe and nothing more.

***ST01_01_00_04_00_00

音瑚(CH01_0019)
『Thinking you can hug the girls whenever, or 
s-stare at them with pervy eyes just because 
you're paying a lot--』

***ST01_01_00_03_00_00

音瑚(CH01_0020)
『I know you can't help your gaze but, touching's 
not on the table. ...Never was, never will be. 
Just because we show a bit of skin, doesn't mean...』

Even I didn't think she'd be this mistaken about 
this stuff. Man, I can't exactly go out of my way 
to touch her or do anything more now.

But wait. That means... she hasn't done any of the 
more depraved 'services' here, huh?

That must mean... she's very likely still a 
virgin. Forget that, she's probably never had a 
man touch her.

My deflating heart started feeling excited again.

***ST01_00_00_00_00_00

音瑚(CH01_0021)
『You've been quiet for a bit... did I say 
something weird?』

主人公
『Nah. I understand how you feel, I do.』

For now, let's just smile and nod.

//ＳＥ：メールの着信音

***SE_se_maoudamashii_onepoint28

音瑚
『....?』

主人公
『Ah--, sorry. I forgot to put it on vibrate.』

I pull out my phone and look at it and what do you 
know, it's my boss. That's rare, after hours too. 
It might be urgent.

音瑚(CH01_0022)
『Is it from your girlfriend?』

主人公
『Eh? Why?』

***ST01_00_00_00_01_00

音瑚(CH01_0023)
『You're looking at it really seriously.』

主人公
『Nah, it's from my office... They might be calling 
me in. We might have to wrap it up here for today, 
sorry.』

Unable to come up with a clever response, I ended 
up replying honestly.

***ST01_00_00_00_01_00

音瑚(CH01_0024)
『I see. Erhm, come to see me again... that's fine, 
right? They told me to say that.』

主人公
『Yeah, it's good. I'll come again.』

//黒背景

It doesn't seem like it's anything urgent at the 
office, but I don't feel like going back inside 
either, at this point. She's probably gonna make a face too.

I was really hoping to get closer to her today 
too... But, it's not like I'm used to this stuff 
either, I guess. It was only my 4th visit today.

Not to mention, just getting to know that nobody's 
laid a hand on her yet makes the visit worth it.

//背景：ロビー
***BGround_BG01_01


Even though we only just met, all I can think of 
is her.

My luck must be amazing, to be able to book an 
adorable girl like her everyday like this.

Once we're closer and she trusts me more, I can 
just slowly and gently lead her....

主人公
『Haaah.... Neko-chan....』

？？？(CH02_0000)
『Oh my, are you looking for Neko-chan?』

Judging by how close the voice was and realizing 
that I almost bumped into someone, I stopped and 
looking at the presence right before me.

//兎萌立ち絵イン

***ST02_00_00_01_01_06

？？？(CH02_0001)
『Are you alright?』

I hurriedly took a step back and put some distance 
between us. A girl with an aura just as soft as 
her voice was standing there, looking at me.

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00

主人公
『I-I'm sorry, I didn't notice....』

***ST02_01_00_00_01_00

？？？(CH02_0002)
『Are you looking for Neko-chan's room? Or perhaps 
you're troubled by something? I can call the staff 
over if need be.』

主人公
『Ah, erhm, no... I was just about to head back 
home....』

I didn't know I was saying all that outloud. How 
embarrassing.

Her gaze and appearance was so gentle and soft, I 
couldn't take my eyes off her.

***ST02_20_00_06_06_00

？？？(CH02_0003)
『Oh, perhaps, are you the customer that's been 
patronizing Neko-chan a lot lately...?』

主人公
『Ah, yes... I suppose I am.』

Looking at her closer, there's a long fluffy pair of ears wrapped 
in smooth hair poking out of her head. I wonder if she's a rabbit 
demi-human... I guess that means she's one of the cast here too, huh?

***ST02_02_00_01_01_00

？？？(CH02_0004)
『I'm sorry for asking so many questions without 
even telling you my name. I'm Tomoe, a cast member 
here.』

Tomoe... san. A cutesy word like "chan" doesn't 
fit her mature and gentle charm.

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00

兎萌(CH02_0005)
『I didn't mean to eavesdrop on you, but I just... 
I heard Neko-chan's name, so I thought that 
maybe...』

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00

兎萌(CH02_0006)
『But I could have just misheard, so... Fufuh, I'm 
glad. Uhm, are you in a rush right now?』

主人公
『No, I have some time. I just came over a bit ago. But 
I really couldn't get her to open her heart to me, so I 
thought I'd head back home and try again another day...』

If it was a serious rush, they'd call me. Forget 
that, I'm more interested in her, she seems to 
know Neko-chan.

***ST02_00_00_02_01_00

兎萌(CH02_0007)
『My oh my... Uhm, I do think we're blocking the 
pathway for others, so if you would follow me...』

She signalled towards a corner of the lobby and 
walked off, as if leading the way to me.

兎萌(CH02_0008)
『Thank you very much, for always patronizing 
Neko-chan.』

Suddenly being given a very formal bow, I stared 
in wonder at Tomoe-san, who was talking as if she 
was one of the staff.

***ST02_30_00_01_01_30

兎萌(CH02_0009)
『Was that a bit too stiff, I wonder? I joined here 
at the same time as her, so we're quite close to 
each other.』

主人公
『I see... Uhm, say. Does Neko-chan laugh when 
she's with you, Tomoe-san?』

***ST02_30_00_05_00_30

兎萌(CH02_0010)
『Of course. ...I believe she's doing her best in her own little way, 
however the past few clients that have visited her have apparently 
been a bit too aggressive so... she tends to shut herself in quite easily.』

When I heard that Neko-chan laughs happily too, 
rather than feeling depressed over the difference 
in how she acts around me, I felt more relieved instead.

***ST02_30_00_01_01_30

兎萌(CH02_0011)
『But lately, I've seen her moving around busily, 
yet she hasn't come to me much to ask for advice 
regarding her clients either so...』

***ST02_30_00_02_01_30

兎萌(CH02_0012)
『Knowing that she's been blessed with such a good 
client made me happy too. I'm sorry for surprising 
you with that bow earlier, fufuh.』

...So she hasn't gone to her to complain about my 
daily bookings, or how I treat her, huh?

主人公
『You know, hearing you say that just makes me want 
to be a better client to her even more. Else, she 
might get fed up and quit out of nowhere someday...』

I've read online about that happening before, how 
some hostesses get annoyed by certain customers to 
the point of quietly transferring to another club.

And knowing Neko-chan, she'd be in high demand 
too.

***ST02_30_00_05_00_30

兎萌(CH02_0013)
『Nn~... I'm fairly sure she can't do that, so 
while it may sound off coming from another one of 
the cast, please do treat her well, okay?』

Seeing her ask me that so nicely and sweetly makes 
me want to do it even more. But what she said 
threw me off.

主人公
『...Can't?』

兎萌(CH02_0014)
『I suppose "won't" would be more apt. Ah--, please 
do keep that a secret though, that I was the one 
who told you that.』

She restated it softly, yet I heard a bit of panic 
in her voice. I could only nod.

兎萌(CH02_0015)
『I've actually told her to do the same before. But she 
just said that she has to make it work, no matter what. 
...Apparently, this is the only place where her kin are.』

***ST02_30_00_05_01_30

She looked at me with earnest eyes.

兎萌(CH02_0016)
『Even I don't know the details... I'm sorry. I 
hope you can be a good client to her, one that 
patronizes her for a long time.』

As soon as she was done saying that, her soft and 
fluffy aura came back.

***ST02_30_00_00_27_30

兎萌(CH02_0017)
『If you ask for me one of these days, I might just 
make it up to you for it too, by serving you 
plenty.』

Her sudden sweet smile and tone made my heart skip 
a beat. My singlemindedness towards Neko-chan 
almost faltered.

主人公
『W-Well then, I have to go now...』

***ST02_30_00_01_02_30

兎萌(CH02_0018)
『Please do come see us again.』

I left the club with sweet words full of emotions 
sending me off, unlike with Neko-chan.

***ST02_00_00_01_02_05

//黒画面
***BGround_BG99_00
***FadeOutBlack

From what she said, Neko-chan has nowhere else to 
go, with her only kin being here in Demi Stage 
Cafe.

That's why, even if I stopped hiding my desires, 
she won't go to another club, or rather, she 
can't. That's why she's trying her best.

...It's not like I don't want to do lots more 
myself. But for now, I'll focus on trying to make 
her laugh and be more comfortable around me.

I went to the counter right away and made another 
appointment for tomorrow. The store's treatment of 
clients gets even better after the 4th visit.

It went smoothly, I could even book her for the 
entire day if I wanted to. Let's see her again 
tomorrow.


--The next day--

***BGround_BG00_00

//黒画面終わり

***BGround_BG01_01
***BGM_Mad_Trick

I wrapped up work much earlier today, and got to 
the club a bit early. Time to deal with the 
reception.

The moment the words about having reserved 
Neko-chan left my mouth... the staff's expression 
changed.

スタッフ
『We're very very sorry, sir. Indeed, you certainly did 
reserve her for today, however... it seems that there was 
a misunderstanding somewhere, and she's already booked...』

主人公
『Eh? But when I called, you said she was available 
all night...』

スタッフ
『It was a blunder on our end, so please do accept 
our apologies. Please, the fees for your next 
visit will be waived. Please do wait a moment.』

I received both an earnest apology and a card too. 
I guess the next visit's gonna be on the house if 
I show this?

They even confirmed my booking for tomorrow, and 
apologized even more, so I had no choice but to 
back off.

I wasn't entirely convinced but I guess it is what 
it is. I'll drop by the restroom before I go back 
home.

***BGround_BG99_01

The moment I was about to leave the stall after 
doing my business, I heard two people walk in 
while being loud and rowdy, and my hand stopped.

***BGM_マーブルコーヒー


スタッフＡ
『Haah, I think that was the first time I've ever 
seen the boss run out like that. The other 
managers were right behind too...』

So it's the staff, huh? I guess that's why they're 
so loud. ...Man, it's hard to get out now. Not to 
mention, they'd probably just hold me up too.

スタッフＢ
『It was Neko, wasn't it?』

...Eh? ...Neko-chan?

スタッフＡ
『Yep, that girl. Just why the hell did they assign 
someone like her, who doesn't even know the 's' of 
'service', to the biggest VIP we have?』

スタッフＢ
『God knows. From what I heard, they asked for her 
by name, apparently.』

My ears perked up. ....That explains why my 
reservation was cancelled, and the staff's 
attitude at the reception.

It was because someone very important for the club 
came and asked for Neko-chan.

スタッフＡ
『Ah, she's done for. She's gonna be fired for 
sure. Either that or she's probably being chewed 
out right now.』

They didn't mention the details, but what I did 
understand now was that she made a ridiculously 
big mistake.

スタッフＢ
『After all, with all her clients drying up one 
after another thanks to her attitude, she's only 
got one left, and he's a new one too...』

That's probably me. I guess that's why Tomoe-san 
was being so lavish with her thanks.

スタッフＡ
『Even if her head doesn't land on the chopping 
block, she's probably gonna be disciplined hard, and 
made to 'service' her clients thoroughly going forward.』

...They're probably referring to the more depraved 
behind-the-scenes stuff, that brings in the 
customers here.

I guessed as much from the room but, the rumours 
really were true, huh?

スタッフＢ
『The question is, will she be able to do it? 
Considering how naive she is about this place....』

スタッフＡ
『She has to, else we can't fix this. If the VIP 
distances himself from us, we might end up in a 
bigger shitstorm.』

スタッフＢ
『Haa... God knows if we'll get our paycheques if 
that happens...』

Laughing bitterly, they both left the restroom.

***BGM_FadeOut

//背景：店のフロント（最初のやつがあれば）

***BGround_BG00_00


From the restroom to the exit, I made my way out 
stealthily so that I wasn't noticed by the staff.

That story from earlier, and what Tomoe-san said 
to me... remembering them suddenly made me feel 
gloomy.

Even if the other customers don't notice her now, 
it might not last...

At this rate, someone else might 'take' her first. 
I'd rather avoid that, if possible.

...Right, there's one option.

If I book her everyday, from opening to closing 
time, it might just work out.

If I do that, the rumours about her and her 
particular 'services' probably won't get out.

Thankfully, I've got a decent job, and 0 hobbies 
and friends too, so my savings are pretty deep.

If she starts making money, they probably won't 
fire her either.

With the situation being like this, she'll 
probably be a whole lot more proactive about 
serving me too.

She might even come onto me... I wonder what I'd 
do in that situation? ...My expectations and 
fantasies run wild.

No no no, the hell am I thinking? I should be more 
concerned about Neko-chan right now...

I rushed down the road home, conflicted between my 
desire to be a gentleman and my other, more 
selfish and perverted desires.

//背景：黒画面

***BGround_BG99_01
***BGM_異次元のセピア

The next day, when I called into the Demi Stage Cafe 
to confirm my reservation, I received yet another 
apology, and was told that I couldn't book Neko-chan.

When I asked if she was on holiday, they immediately 
said yes, and recommended other cast members. I can't 
exactly tell them that I know what happened yesterday.

I'm getting worried now. I hope they're not 
forcing anything ridiculous upon her while using 
the holiday as an excuse...

I got the same response the next day, and the day 
after that too. The anxiety born out of my worries 
and my desires just kept growing.

Finally, on the day after that, I was able to get 
a booking in. ...I can see her, I can see 
Neko-chan.




//背景：ロビー

***BGround_BG01_01

I deal with the reception while calming down my 
throbbing emotions, and hurry to Neko-chan's room.

These past few days, I've been expecting and 
fantasizing and worrying a whole lot but for now, 
I just want to see her face and relax.

Before I can even get a good look at her and see

***ST01_00_00_01_01_05


主人公
『Thanks.』

***ST01_50_00_01_01_50

音瑚(CH01_0027)
『Nn--! Uhm--... no, I mean, erhm, enjoy yourself. 
I-I'll try my best... too, so.』

It does come off a bit awkward but, she's probably 
doing her best in her own way here.

From what I could see anyway, she didn't look hurt 
or injured at all, which was a big relief to me.

***ST01_50_00_06_00_50

音瑚(CH01_0028)
『What's got you staring at me?』

She's finally being cheery for once. Alright, 
let's not show her even a single hint that I know 
about the matter from the other day.

Forget sighing, she's not even scowling at me. 
That's a big change, I bet she was chewed out a 
lot.

Alright, time to bury my desires deep inside, I 
can't betray her. For now, I want to keep being a 
gentleman to her.

主人公
『Nothing, I'm just happy to see you so lively, 
that's all. I'm really happy to see you today.』

***ST01_50_00_00_01_50


音瑚(CH01_0029)
『M-Me too... I guess.』

The moment she mumbled that, she scooched over a 
bit towards me, vigorously. Her soft scent tickled 
my nose.

The surprise attack and the sweet fragrance went 
beyond making my heart skip and ended up arousing 
me too. ...I can't do this.

主人公
『Right, I came here in a rush so I didn't order 
anything. I'll place an order now. Want something 
to drink?』

***ST01_50_00_00_05_50


音瑚(CH01_0030)
『Ah--, I can't do alco...--!... Erhm... uhm.... 
the alcohol here is... v-very pricey so, you don't 
need to, go out of your way to...』

Seems like she's still wary of me. But I want to 
support her too, for all her efforts.

主人公
『It's been a while since we've seen each other, so I 
just want to splurge on you. I know you don't like it 
so you don't have to drink it, just let me order it?』

***ST01_50_00_20_05_50


音瑚(CH01_0031)
『--!... T-Thanks...』

When I came back to the couch after placing the other, she 
seemed somehow embarrassed. She wasn't telling me off for 
trying to sit down next to her either. She looked somehow absentminded.

***ST01_50_00_00_05_50

音瑚(CH01_0032)
『...Really... you don't have to do this for me, 
you know... Ah, the drinks are here. I'll go get 
them!』

***ST01_50_00_00_05_60

Feeling like I saw her a bit of her real self just 
there, I firmly suppressed the urge to smile, else 
she might just scold me again.

***SE_FOOTSTEPS_Trainers_Asphalt_Run_x8_loop_mono

They handed the tray to her, looks like.

***ST01_50_00_00_05_50

She came back, and sat down.

***ST01_50_00_06_00_50


音瑚(CH01_0033)
『...*sniff sniff*... Nn... huh? What is this...? 
It doesn't smell very alcohol-y.』

What I ordered were one of the more cliche drinks, 
Kahlua & Milk.  She put the tray down on the table 
and looked at the glasses with curiosity.

***ST01_50_00_00_05_50


音瑚(CH01_0034)
『...Right! Since you went out of your way to order 
them, I... I can't drink it so, I'll cast a spell 
on it instead!』

主人公
『Eh?... You'll do that for me?』

That might be the most surprising thing for me 
today. That 'spell' is a cute performance where 
the girls presents you the drink with a cute gesture.

It's one of the basic services that this club is 
full of but, when I pestered her for it the first 
time I came over, she flatly refused.

***ST01_50_00_04_05_50

音瑚(CH01_0035)
『Yeah! I-I dunno whether I can do it properly but, 
I'm one of the cast here too, so--!』

主人公
『You sure? You don't need to force yourself...』

***ST01_50_00_24_05_50


音瑚(CH01_0036)
『I'm not forcing myself!』

I tried to throw her a lifeline, but it had the 
opposite effect. She's changed so much. But of 
course, if she'll do it, I'm not gonna say no.

音瑚(CH01_0037)
『Fuuh... then, here I go....』

『N... Nyan nyan nyan--! With my magical cat

I seriously got a bit captivated.

『!!....』

音瑚(CH01_0040)
『O-Okay, I'm not holding back--!!!』

主人公
『Eh?』

***SE_drinking1
Before I could stop her, she picked up the glass 
and gulped it down in one go with her face flushed 
to her ears.

***ST01_50_00_26_00_50

音瑚(CH01_0041)
『H-Huh... it's tasty...? It doesn't taste 
alcohol-y at all.』

***ST01_50_00_20_01_50


主人公
『But you gulped it down all at once... you can't 
handle alcohol, no?』

音瑚(CH01_0042)
『I feel fine though. Unlike the clear stuff, this 
doesn't taste like alcohol at all. It's like milk 
coffee...』

Her face was still so red, even I couldn't tell 
whether that was the alcohol or what.

音瑚(CH01_0043)
『C'mon, you try it too. It seriously doesn't taste 
alcohol-y.』

主人公
『I know, don't worry.』

***ST01_50_00_21_02_50


音瑚(CH01_0044)
『I'm telling you, it's really tasty~... C'mon, 
let's drink it together?』

主人公
『....I'd love to, but your glass is empty... but 
I'm happy to see you like it so much. Want me to 
order more?』

***ST01_50_00_22_02_50


音瑚(CH01_0045)
『Sure--!! I'll drink more--』

---------........

After that, I ordered two, three more glasses, and 
she drank the alcohol she feared so much like a 
little kid drinking juice.

She even gulped down the leftover bit in my own 
glass, and before I could cheer at that indirect 
kiss.... she fell asleep.

***SE_MOVEMENT_Snow_RR1_mono

For the time being, let's carry her to the bed.

『Zzz....--!.... Zzz.... Zzz....』


***LoopCV_0000


She atleast looks like she's blissfully asleep. 
She said she couldn't handle alcohol, didn't 
she...?

God knows what'd happen if I just left her be, so 
I might as well stick around. She's... just 
sleeping, right?

Guess I'll try poking her cheek and see if she 
reacts.


***Cinema_0001



音瑚(CH01_0047)
『....Nnn... Nnyah.... ah, fuuh....』

Great. Atleast it's not alcohol poisoning or 
anything. Still though, she's got such soft skin.

It's so moist and hot, I can almost feel it 
clinging to my fingers.

Now my crotch's acting up too.

I could probably get away with touching her right 
now. It'll be fine, it's just some light 
touching...

***Cinema_0002


Ooooooh.... it's so moist yet so smooth and slick, 
I can't even describe it properly.

Let's see, her chest....

***Cinema_0003

Uwooooooh... as superb a feel as I expected. No, 
it's better. I wanna lick them. I want to play 
with them all day.

音瑚(CH01_0048)
『Zzz.... Zzz... Nnn....』

***Cinema_0004


Woah, that was close. Is she up again? I can't 
tell...

音瑚(CH01_0049)
『Nyuh~... zzz..... !... zzz.... Nnn... zzzz....』

Phew... J-Just one more time, let's wake her up 
after that, yeah. Just once...

***Cinema_0005


音瑚(CH01_0050)
『Fuh, ah--... ah... nn....』

Those moans just made my man stand up straight... 
I mean, I was getting ready for a real war what 
with all this but, I'm actually feeling it now.

It's so erect, it actually kinda hurts. It doesn't 
seem like she's gonna wake up just yet either, I 
wanna take it out while touching her thighs...


***Cinema_0006


音瑚(CH01_0051)
『....Zzz.... zzz....』

Soft, squishy, and sexy. But she isn't reacting as 
much. I guess her chest's her most sensitive part, 
huh...

Not good, I can't take it anymore--... it's too much--.... 
She's not gonna keep sleeping if I put it in either. But 
just stroking it like this feels wasteful too. It feels pathetic.

***Cinema_0007


主人公
『I-I can't put it in, so...』

***Cinema_0008


While watching her every reaction very carefully, I 
took out my thing. Rubbing it against her thighs is 
making so much pre-cum gush out. I can use it as lotion.

主人公
『!... Hah....』

Her soft, warm skin is wrapping around my rod, 
with the head of it effortlessly burying itself 
inside.

It feels so good... So smooth and slippery....

***Cinema_0009


音瑚(CH01_0052)
『Nnn... Zzz... zzzz...』

I want to thrust hard. As hard as I can. But I 
want to keep savouring this sensual pleasure too.

I'm dryhumping her. Grinding against her soft 
thighs, while she lays there with a cute face. 
Feeling the skin probably nobody else has, ever...


I want to cum on her face... but if I move that 
much, she'll cum. But I can't stop. I'm gonna, 
cum--...

***Cinema_0010

主人公
『Uu--...』

...She's up. And I almost got done cumming too. My 
dick's still erect, still pushing out the last 
little bit of sperm.

音瑚(CH01_0054)
『Nn~... what... water? ...Did I... fall 
asleep....?』



音瑚(CH01_0055)
『Eh... what is this... ew--... eeeeeh?! ...--No 
way.... what is this--??!』

Why now, why right now... What do I do...

『Huh... what, were you... eh--, eh--... no, what 
are... what are you doing--!!』

『No, well, this is...』

slimey... hey! What is this!!』

『Uhm, it's because you... tempted me so 
aggressively... Neko-chan....』

***ST01_40_00_03_03_00


音瑚(CH01_0058)
『Haah--?! ~~Why the hell would I ever--!! I-I was just, 
trying to serve you more assertively for once, I 
didn't... I didn't mean anything dirty by it--!! You're filthy!』

主人公
『I mean, you were the one who fell asleep without 
any sort of vigilance, so...』

音瑚(CH01_0059)
『It was the alcohol, not me, I'm not used to it! 
Don't twist things to make them more convenient 
for you!』

音瑚(CH01_0060)
『Just put that filthy thing back inside already!! 
I'll go call the staff!』

Damn. If she calls the staff in, forget saving 
her, she's gonna be directly ruined....

Not knowing what to do, my head started spinning. 
Before I realized it, I was shouting at her.

主人公
『That's the sort of place this is!! Not to mention, 
you messed up big time the other day, didn't you? 
You were ordered to do it with customers or else, no?!』

***Face01_04_04

音瑚(CH01_0061)
『--! How do you know tha....』

主人公
『I was never planning on forcing myself on you, 
Neko-chan. B-But if you're just gonna be taken by 
someone else then...!』

When she spread her legs, I saw my sperm stringing 
out between her thighs.

Her flushed face, and her scent that I sniffed 
just a few minutes ago... it's all rushing to my 
head. My dick's back to full power again, somehow.

音瑚(CH01_0062)
『I-I do... n-need customers to choose me, but--... 
I-I don't need it to be you and your thing--! I'm 
not gonna beg either--! Get out.』

If I leave right now, I'll probably never see her 
face again. If anything, she'll just be taken by 
someone else instead.


***Face01_03_03


音瑚(CH01_0063)
『I'm telling you to get out!! The hell are you 
looking at me for! Get out--!』

Seeing her resist me so intensely without 
understanding a single thing made blood rush to my 
head.

主人公
『...--! The only choice you have is to do it with 
me, Neko-chan!!』

***ST01_05_00_00_00_05
***BGround_BG99_01


It's the same for me. If she's going to resist this 
much then I have no choice but to force it on her. No 
choice, but to assault her and make her understand...!

音瑚(CH01_0064)
『No--, what--, what are you--?! Don't come 
closer--!!!』

I didn't know whether it was out of a desire to 
protect her, a desire to possess her, or just pure 
lust. But in the end, I pushed her down.
