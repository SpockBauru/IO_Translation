『Haa, haa, haa...hic...h, haa.』

I cummed as much as I wanted, and moved like I 
wanted. But it was still not enough...

主人公
『No matter how much you reject me...you would have 
ended up with someone eventually. It was bound to 
happen sooner or later.』

音瑚(CH01_0066)
『Hick…*sob*...*sob*...*sob*...*sob*...』

主人公
『You have no customers other than me to begin 
with, so there's no way you'd get chosen. That's 
why I'll continue to call for Neko-chan.』

主人公
『You no longer have the power to refuse. You have 
no choice but to be with me.』

It's come to this. From here on out, it'll 
probably be impossible to get along with her.

Besides, after getting to know the taste of 
Neko-chan's body, I have no intention of keeping 
up the relationship we had.

And then I leave the room.

//扉バタン
***SE_DOOR_Wood_Bedroom_Close_01_mono
Then I went to the lobby.

Everything I did happened in the heat of the 
moment. But maybe it was a good opportunity.

If I come to the club as a well paying customer, a 
cast member in debt

would finally start earning money. Then I probably 
would no longer be turned away or be unable to 
make reservations.

The club would be in a pinch if Neko-chan couldn't 
make money for the big problem she caused. Even if 
it means she's forced to...

When I left Neko-chan's room and went to the 
lobby, I heard a voice from behind.

？？？(CH02_0019)
『Fufu, you had a lot of fun today.』

主人公
『Oh, uh...』

 I look back. It's a familiar voice. But I forgot 
her name.

『It's Tomoe. Sorry for calling out to you so 
suddenly.』

主人公
『Oh, don't worry about it.』

***ST02_00_00_02_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0021)
『Fufu, did you choose Neko-chan today as well? You 
really like that girl, don't you?』

Tomoe-san, who doesn't know what happened, smiles 
happily.

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0022)
『It's been a while since you started coming here. 
Have you gotten used to the place? You've 
accumulated some points, right?』

主人公
『Points? ...No, this is the first time I'm hearing 
about points...』

When I said that, her face turned from a surprised 
reaction to a smug, bitter smile.

***ST02_00_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0023)
『Geez, Neko-chan...You forgot to give it to this 
young man who likes you a lot.』

『Alright, here. Don't tell anyone that I gave it

『“This is the reward card for Demi Cafe. You can 
collect points by ‘playing’ in the club.』

兎萌(CH02_0026)
『On your way out, get your points from the cast 
member you played with that day.』


***BGround_BG07_01

兎萌(CH02_0027)
『You can use your accumulated points to...For 
example, change Neko-chan's appearance to your 
liking.』

兎萌(CH02_0028)
『You can also unlock special services.』

***BGround_BG09_01

兎萌(CH02_0029)
『Oh right...There is also special play that can be 
unlocked for Neko-chan and I under certain 
conditions, fufu.』

主人公
『Tomoe-san...I think you're better than the 
staff.』

兎萌(CH02_0032)
『Fufu, I suppose it's from experience of working 
at noon. Ah yes, and...』

***BGround_BG10_01

兎萌(CH02_0033)
『Obviously, the amount of time you can play in a 
day is limited. So you can't do everything you 
want.』

兎萌(CH02_0034)
『The elapsed time and points you receive depend on 
the type of play, so please think carefully about 
how you want to play that day.』

兎萌(CH02_0035)
『Anyway, that's about it regarding the reward 
card...』

兎萌(CH02_0036)
『At first, I think you should spend it as you like 
without thinking about it too much.』

『Sorry for the long explanation. I stopped you on 
your way home...』

主人公
『Ah, no...』

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00

兎萌(CH02_0038)
『Oh, right. To make up for forgetting to give you 
the card, I'll add a lot of points for you. I'm 
really sorry about that.』

It seems that Tomoe-san added a lot of points, and 
then handed me the card.

***ST02_00_00_05_01_00

兎萌(CH02_0039)
『So, please don't blame Neko-chan for not passing 
the card on. Please.』

***ST02_00_00_02_01_00

兎萌(CH02_0040)
『I added quite a bit, so please use it as soon as 
possible if you like. Well then, that's all from 
me...』

//兎萌立ち絵はけ

***ST02_00_00_02_01_05

So this is the Demi Cafe reward card...It looks 
like I can do a lot with this according to 
Tomoe-san's explanation.

***BGM_FadeOut

So do I use it now, or save it for later...?
