I came over today without a booking in place.

I'm the only one who ever books her anyway, so I 
don't book in advance unless I know I'm gonna come 
for sure.

Dealing with my business in the restroom, I made 
my way to the main desk and ended up looking 
around the lobby.

The lobby felt needlessly, indulgently vast, with 
only a few staff and some cast members waiting for 
their clients populating it.

I also saw some of the cast members sitting at the 
box seats, talking to each other and giggling in 
low voices.

？？？(CH02_0053)
『Hey....』

A voice called out to me, from the lounge with all 
the box seats.

兎萌(CH02_0054)
『Uhm, if you have some time... I'd like to chat a 
bit.』

I nodded, and sat down on the box seat she led me 
to.

主人公
『What's the matter?』

***ST02_00_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0055)
『It's uhm... uhm... the other day...』

***ST02_00_00_05_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0056)
『While it's true that I was a bit drunk... I'm 
still very sorry for doing what I did.』

Drunk? The other day...? Aah, right. In the end, 
neither of us were able to control ourselves that 
day so...

I ended up banging her thoroughly, someone like 
her who'd never done the real thing in the club 
before.

***ST02_00_00_05_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0057)
『You were just so easy to talk to, onii-san... I 
couldn't help myself and ended up drinking so 
much...』

Yeah but, it was a one time thing. And she was 
drunk too.

Then again, seems like she herself keeps beating 
herself over it and doesn't think of it that way.

***ST02_00_00_05_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0058)
『But uhm... the things that we did... they were because of 
all the alcohol too so, and this might sound like a 
convenient excuse from my end but, I want you to forget about them.』

***ST02_00_00_05_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0059)
『There's my husband too, of course... no, more 
than that, I ended up burdening you with my own 
sexual needs, onii-san...』

***ST02_00_00_05_00_00
兎萌(CH02_0060)
『I'll try not to ever do it again, so please?』

As I stayed quiet and didn't say a word, she kept 
throwing that gaze at me, badgering me to forget.

主人公
『Is that, so... I'm sorry as well, since I let the 
mood get to me as well at that time. But...』

If she's gonna put some distance between us 
anyway, I might as well say it now.

主人公
『It felt wonderful to do it with you, Tomoe-san.』

***ST02_00_00_06_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0061)
『...Eh?』

主人公
『We both were very drunk there, I won't deny that, 
but at the same time, I was still very conscious 
of it all...』

主人公
『Your skin was so soft, Tomoe-san, and it smelled 
so nice... and your body reacted so nicely, so 
cutely.』

***ST02_00_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0062)
『D-Don't... c-compliment me like... no, being 
complimented like that feels very nice but...』

主人公
『I think I understand why you don't do the... real 
thing... here in the club.』

***ST02_00_00_06_00_00
兎萌(CH02_0063)
『Eh... what do you mean?』

主人公
『You're just so attractive and sexy, I can understand 
why you'd be scared of customers misunderstanding and 
clinging to you, if you do such wonderful things for them.』

***ST02_01_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0064)
『...Fufuh... jeez, don't tease me. It's not like 
that at all. You already know the real reason... I 
told it to you the other day....』

主人公
『...It's because of your husband, isn't it?』

Even if these are box seats, we're still in the 
lobby. So I asked in a very low voice.

***ST02_01_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0065)
『Yeah...』

主人公
『Personally, I would never be able to leave a 
wonderful wife like you behind and go on a 
business trip like that.』

The more I speak... the more I can feel her 
confusion and puzzlement turning into 
embarrassment and joy.

***ST02_01_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0066)
『Don't say that... jeez. It's not like I'm 
stupid... even I know that he's working so much 
for my sake...』

If she knows that... I do wonder why she doesn't 
turn me down.

To begin with, even if she doesn't do the 'real 
deed' with her clients, she still comes here to 
work everyday despite knowing what this place is about.

主人公
『If I had such a young and beautiful wife like you, I 
wouldn't be able to take it and come home right away. 
What a lucky man your husband is, I'm honestly jealous.』

***ST02_01_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0067)
『C'mon, always with that... I'm not that young 
anymore, you know...』

Normally, if a man says this much... it's the same 
as him saying that he wants to have sex again. And 
yet she's not pushing me away, or even rebuking me.

主人公
『It surprised me when you called out to me earlier 
but, just being with you like this is enough to 
make my heart pound now, Tomoe-san.』

***ST02_01_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0068)
『Jeez, you're such a sweettalker...』

She's saying all that but, she probably wants it 
inside. ...I'll try pulling back a bit.

主人公
『...I'm sorry. You came to ask me to forget about 
it, didn't you? You're very sweet and easy to talk 
to, so I ended up dragging it out...』

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0069)
『No, it's fine. I was the one who stopped you and 
asked you to listen... You're going to go see 
Neko-chan again today, no?』

As I was getting up from the chair, I felt her hot 
gaze staring through me.

主人公
『...Ah, erhm... I still haven't made up my mind about 
that. But we did just do that last time so, even if I were 
to make an appointment with you... it'd just be a bother, no?』

***ST02_00_00_11_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0070)
『...No. Not at all. Uhm... If it's still alright 
with you, onii-san, even after knowing....』

And there it is. She finished it off with "please 
ask for me". She fell easier than I expected.

She was telling me to forget it, but it was her 
herself who couldn't forget all the passionate 
stuff we did last time.

When I sat my ass back down again and returned her 
gaze, she let out a very small sigh of relief, and 
put her hands on mine.

Within her moist eyes, I could see her lust and 
sexual craving. No matter how you slice it, she's 
hungry for it too.

I'm sure that at first, she probably came to 
earnestly ask me to forget about what we did but, 
in the end, her lust as a rabbit won out.

If I push her a bit, she'll probably let me do her 
again. She's clearly hoping for it too, afterall.

Seeing her blushing cheeks, my desire and arousal 
hit new highs.

...So. I ended up making her long for it this 
badly, but I came here for Neko-chan in the first 
place.

Tantalizing her by booking Neko-chan sounds like a 
fun time too. Now then, what should I do...
