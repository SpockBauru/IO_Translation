I came to Demi Cafe today without a reservation.

I'm the only one who calls on Neko-chan anyway, 
and I refrain from booking unless I’m absolutely 
sure I can show up.

After using the toilet, I looked around the lobby 
while heading to the reception desk.

The lobby feels luxuriously vast, with only a few 
people consisting of the staff and cast members 
waiting for customers.

There were also other cast members in the booth 
seats talking happily with low voices.

？？？(CH02_0053)
『Hey...』

I heard a voice from the booth seats.

『Um, if you have time...Can we talk for a bit?』

I nodded and sat in the booth seat.

主人公
『What’s wrong?』

***ST02_00_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0055)
『About...the other day...』

***ST02_00_00_05_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0056)
『Even though I was drunk...I'm sorry for what I 
did.』

Drunk? The other day…? Ahhh, I guess we both 
couldn’t stop ourselves at that moment...

I had banged Tomoe-san, who never had sex in the 
club.

***ST02_00_00_05_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0057)
『Onii-san is just so easy to talk to...I got 
drunk...』

That said, it was only a one time thing, 
especially since she was drunk.

But the brooding Tomoe-san doesn’t seem to think 
so.

***ST02_00_00_05_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0058)
『But what happened...this might sound like an 
excuse, but it was the alcohol, so please forget 
it ever happened.』

***ST02_00_00_05_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0059)
『Of course there are issues with my husband...But 
more than anything, I inconvenienced you with my 
frustrations...』

***ST02_00_00_05_00_00
兎萌(CH02_0060)
『I'll never do it again, okay?』

As I listen silently the whole time, she shows me 
a gaze urging me to forget.

主人公
『Is...that so. I'm also sorry for getting carried 
away. But...』

If she’s obviously trying to set some distance 
between us, I’ll be upfront.

主人公
『Doing it with you felt so sooooo good.』

***ST02_00_00_06_05_00
兎萌(CH02_0061)
『...eh.』

主人公
『Normally, being told it was the alcohol would’ve 
been the end of it, but I was fairly conscious 
that time...』

主人公
『Tomoe-san's skin was so soft and supple with a 
nice scent...and your reaction was very cute.』

***ST02_00_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0062)
『Y-you don’t have to...Err, I'm happy with your 
compliments, but...』

主人公
『I think...I know why Tomoe-san doesn’t have sex.』

***ST02_00_00_06_00_00
兎萌(CH02_0063)
『Huh...what do you mean?』

主人公
『It's because you’re so attractive and sexy, and 
if you go all the way, the customers would 
misunderstand and obsess over you.』

***ST02_01_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0064)
『Fufu...don't tease me. That's not true. I told 
you exactly why I don’t have sex...』

主人公
『...It’s because I have a husband.』

Although this is a booth seat, it’s still in the 
lobby. I confirm with Tomoe-san in a small voice.

***ST02_01_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0065)
『Yes...』

主人公
『If I were your husband, I wouldn’t be able to go 
on a business trip and leave such a wonderful 
person like you alone.』

As I utter words, I can hear something in her 
voice changing from confusion and embarrassment, 
to joy.

***ST02_01_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0066)
『My husband is working far away for my sake, you 
know...』

If she thinks so...then why doesn’t she refuse me?

No matter how much she says she won’t have sex, 
she works here, aware of the services offered by 
the club.

主人公
『If I had such a young and beautiful wife, I 
wouldn't be able to wait and come right back home. 
Your husband is a lucky man.』

***ST02_01_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0067)
『C’mon now...I'm not that young anymore...』

Usually, going this far is the same thing as 
saying I want to have sex again. And even then, I 
wasn’t reprimanded.

主人公
『I was surprised when you called out, but now I'm 
really excited just to be with you.』

***ST02_01_00_05_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0068)
『You’re so good with your words...』

Whatever she’s saying, I'm sure deep down she’s 
expecting something. Let's pull back a little.

主人公
『...Sorry. You were talking about how that never 
happened before. Tomoe-san, you’re kind and easy 
to talk to, so I tend to talk too much...』

***ST02_00_00_01_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0069)
『Oh no, it’s okay. I’m the one who stopped you. 
Are you going to Neko-chan again today?』

As I try to get up from my seat, Tomoe-san stares 
at me with a feverish gaze.

主人公
『Um...I haven't decided yet. But choosing you 
after what happened...wouldn’t it be awkward?』

***ST02_00_00_11_01_00
兎萌(CH02_0070)
『…No, not at all. I mean, if you’re still okay 
with it...』

She wants me to choose her. She fell for it more 
easily than I expected.

She wants me to forget about it, but it’s 
Tomoe-san herself who can't forget that intense 
act.

When I sat down again and stared back, Tomoe-san 
let out a small breath of relief and placed her 
hand on the other.

I can see the color of frustration in her watery 
eyes. There’s no doubt, Tomoe-san is expecting 
something.

At first, Tomoe-san may have come to ask that I 
forget about last time, but she ended up losing to 
her strong rabbit lust.

If I’m a bit forceful, I should be able to fuck 
her again. And she’s clearly expecting it.

When I saw Tomoe-san blushing a little, my 
expectations and excitement rose up tremendously.

So, I've riled up Tomoe-san, but I originally came 
here to see Neko-chan.

It’s fun to tease Tomoe-san by choosing Neko-chan. 
Now then, what to do...
