# IO Translation

English fan translation project for Insult Order. The translations are applied while the game is running and do not require replacing or modifying any game files.

## Prerequisites

- [BepInEx 5.4](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.8)
- [XUnity.AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator)
- [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases)
- [IO_DisableTextScrolling](https://github.com/SpockBauru/SpockPlugins_Miconisomi/releases/tag/r4)
- [IO_ResizeKeypad](https://github.com/SpockBauru/SpockPlugins_Miconisomi/releases/tag/r5)
- [IO_EnglishLauncher](https://github.com/SpockBauru/SpockPlugins_Miconisomi/releases/tag/r5) (Optional, but recommended)

## How translations work

Each translation line follows the pattern: 
```
original text=translated text
```
Example: 
```
悟飯=Food
``` 
Lines beginning with `//` are considered comments, i.e., they are not considered in the translation.

The translations are all inside the `Bepinex\Translation\en` folder. They are then split into the following directories:
- `Text` - Text translations that are loaded when the game opens. If there is no translation, then the original untranslated text is displayed in the game, Google Translator is called, the translated text is written to `_AutoGeneratedTranslations.txt` and only then the translation is displayed in the game. The text in this folder can be handled with regular expressions (Regex).
- `Texture` - Contains the translated version of game images. The game images are translated using image editing software. If available the source files (`.psd`, `.xcf`, etc.) files can be found in the project's `Image Source Files` folder.

## How to add or improve translations in GitHub

- If you want to make a simple edit simply open the file in question and click edit. After you are done editing, commit the changes and start a pull request.
- If you have more translations to submit [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). This will make a copy of the original project in your account. Upload your changes to the fork into your account, and then [send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to the original project. Your pull request will be reviewed and accepted after a quality check. Again, avoid raw machine translations. Proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling is a must.
